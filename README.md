## introduction

For a beginner for python, functions like `input` and `print` are very commonly used, yet that often leave contents unreadable. However, building a **GUI program** is incredibly hard.

This library, served as therapy, will provide them a platform on which all the inputs/outputs will be put on the browser.

requirements:
``` txt
bottle
gunicorn
```
